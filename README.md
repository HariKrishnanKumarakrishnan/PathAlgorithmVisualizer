# Pathfinding Algorithm Animator

## Description

This project is a visual animator for demonstrating how various pathfinding algorithms work, including but not limited to Dijkstra's Algorithm, A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS). It aims to provide an educational tool for understanding the mechanics behind these algorithms through visual representation.

## Features

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports various pathfinding algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra's, BFS, and DFS.
- **Interactive Grid**: Users can draw barriers, set start and end points, and visualize the pathfinding in real-time.
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: Offers the ability to view each step of the algorithm's process.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays time taken and nodes visited for each pathfinding execution.
- **Customizable Grid Size**: Allows users to adjust the grid size to increase or decrease the complexity.
